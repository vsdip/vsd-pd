# VSD-PD Codespace  
**OpenROAD + noVNC Cloud Environment**

This repository launches a **ready-to-use GitHub Codespace** with OpenROAD tools, an XFCE desktop, and browser-based **noVNC** access.  
It is designed for testing and learning **physical design (PD) flows** in a cloud-based environment ‚Äî without needing any local installation.

##  Run OpenROAD Flow Scripts

Once inside the Codespace terminal (or through the noVNC desktop terminal):

```bash
cd ~/Desktop
git clone https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD-flow-scripts.git
cd OpenROAD-flow-scripts/flow
make
````

## If you encounter an error during synthesis, open the TCL file:

```bash
vim scripts/synth_stdcells.tcl
```

Comment out the second `read_liberty` line, as shown below:
![Edit synth\_stdcells.tcl](images/7_commentSecondReadlib.jpg)

Then rerun the flow:

```bash
